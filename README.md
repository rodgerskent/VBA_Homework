This repository holds Kent Rodgers VBA_Homework Results. 
The effort was tackled in three phases
  Phase 1 = Instructions: 
    Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
    a) The ticker symbol.
    b) Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    c) The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    d) The total stock volume of the stock.
    e) You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
    f) The result should look as defined in the instructions resources folder ... {moderate_solution](Images/moderate_solution.png)
  Phase 2 = First Challenge:
    a) The first challenge solution must also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 
    b) The solution will look as defined in the instructions resources folder ... [hard_solution](Images/hard_solution.png)
  Phase 3 = Second Challenge
    a) Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
A Powerpoint with screen shots, the testing file and the multi-year file results were provided (add, push and commit to GitHub) for each of the three phases above.
The two documents that represent that complete solution = 200921_TwoChallenge_ScreenShots_Rodgers.pptx or 200921_TwoChallenge_Multiple_year_stock_data_Rodgers.xlsm
